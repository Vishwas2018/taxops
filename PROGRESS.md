# TaxOps — Progress Log

## Day 1 — Scaffold (2026-07-12)

### Built

- Next.js 16.2.10 app (App Router, TypeScript strict, Turbopack) scaffolded into
  `c:\Users\vishw\Vish\Vish\KeepMore\taxops` — a subdirectory of the parent `KeepMore` dir,
  chosen over renaming the parent (see below).
- Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui initialized (`components.json`), core primitives installed:
  button, input, label, card, checkbox, select, tabs, dialog, badge, separator, sonner,
  table, skeleton, textarea, radio-group.
- Core deps installed: `zod`, `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`,
  `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`.
- Vitest configured (`vitest.config.ts`, jsdom env, 100% coverage thresholds scoped to
  `src/lib/tax/**`) with a first passing unit test (`src/lib/tax/round.ts` +
  `round.test.ts`) to prove the toolchain.
- Playwright configured (`playwright.config.ts`, chromium project, `e2e/` dir created,
  browser binary installed).
- `package.json` scripts added: `typecheck`, `test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`, `e2e`.
- `CLAUDE.md` rewritten as the full project constitution (scope, disclaimer rules,
  calculation rules, privacy, a11y, quality loop, stack decisions, directory layout).
- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` written.
- Supabase local project initialized (`supabase init` → `supabase/config.toml`).
- Migration `supabase/migrations/20260712000000_init_schema.sql`: `profiles`, `checklists`,
  `checklist_items`, `saved_articles`, `saved_scenarios`, all with RLS enabled and
  owner-only policies (`checklist_items` derives ownership through its parent `checklists`
  row since it has no `user_id` column of its own).
- `supabase/seed.sql`: one demo user (`demo@taxops.local` / `password123`) with a sample
  profile, checklist + items, saved article, saved scenario.
- `.env.local.example` for the two public Supabase env vars.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs typecheck → lint → test:coverage → build on push/PR.
- Quality loop verified green: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`
  all pass on the current scaffold.

### Assumptions made (recorded, most conservative option chosen)

1. **Project directory**: brief assumed an empty dir named `taxops`; actual dir was named
   `KeepMore`. Asked the user — confirmed to create a `taxops` subdirectory rather than use
   `KeepMore` as the root.
2. **Next.js 16 naming**: this Next version renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` (same
   purpose). Day 2 auth work will use `proxy.ts`. Documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
3. **Cache Components**: Next 16's opt-in `cacheComponents` flag (PPR / `"use cache"`) is
   left **disabled**. Almost every route here is per-user/auth-gated, so the static-shell
   benefit is small and the mandatory `Suspense`-around-every-dynamic-read discipline isn't
   worth it for v1. Documented as a considered decision in `CLAUDE.md`, not a placeholder.
4. **shadcn form component**: this shadcn/ui version (on `@base-ui/react`, not Radix)
   doesn't ship a `form.tsx` registry item. Installed `react-hook-form` +
   `@hookform/resolvers` directly; a local `src/components/ui/form.tsx` wrapper will be
   built when the first form (Day 4 calculator or Day 6 interview) needs it, rather than
   speculatively now.
5. **Zod v4** installed (latest at scaffold time) rather than pinning v3. No schemas written
   yet to validate against; will confirm v4 API compatibility when
   `src/lib/validation/` schemas are first written (Day 3+).
6. **npm peer deps**: `@vitejs/plugin-react` (via `@rolldown/plugin-babel`) conflicts with
   the `@babel/core` version shadcn's toolchain pulls in — both bleeding-edge packages.
   Resolved with `--legacy-peer-deps` for that one install; devDependency-only, no runtime
   impact. CI's `npm ci` also uses `--legacy-peer-deps` for the same reason.
7. **CI Supabase env var**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in CI falls back to a placeholder
   string since no code yet reads it at build time. Will need a real CI secret (or continue
   with the placeholder) once Day 2 auth code lands — revisit then, not now.

### BLOCKED

- **Docker Desktop is not running** on this machine, so `supabase start` could not be
  executed, meaning the migration and seed script above are **written but not yet verified**
  against a real local Postgres instance. Conservative assumption taken: SQL follows standard
  Supabase local-dev patterns (including the `auth.users` / `auth.identities` seed insert
  pattern), but syntax/constraint errors are possible until run.
  **Action needed from you**: start Docker Desktop, then run `npx supabase start` followed by
  `npx supabase db reset` (applies migrations + seed) from the `taxops` directory. I'll fix
  any errors that surface once you confirm Docker is up, or you can paste the output here.

### Next up — Day 2

Auth (sign up, magic link, sign in/out, protected routes via `proxy.ts`), base layout, nav,
footer with global disclaimer, `<Disclaimer />` component.

## Human gates (for reference)

- ⛔ **Gate 1** (end of Day 3): FY2025-26 rate tables + ATO source URLs presented for sign-off
  before calculator UIs are built on top.
- ⛔ **Gate 2** (end of Day 8): all article content + calculator outputs reviewed against ATO
  guidance; articles stay `draft: true` until approved.
- ⛔ **Gate 3** (end of Day 10): production Supabase project + Vercel env vars + deploy
  approval.
